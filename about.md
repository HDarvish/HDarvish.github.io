<p>
I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering. Meanwhile I am doing my trainsheep in <a href="https://www.bosch.com/">Robert Bosch Company</a>. I consider myself as an engineer and artist and I love working on both ends. I like complex problem solving and coming up with an efficient solution. I am passionate about learning new technologies and implementing them. In my free time, I usually draw, paint, or read (while listening to music). Finally, I love listening to great music and being in nature.
