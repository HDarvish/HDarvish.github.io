<p>
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the <a href="https://www.unisalento.it/">University of Salento</a> in Italy. Meanwhile, I am doing my trainsheep in <a href="https://www.bosch.com/">Robert Bosch Company</a> working on the lithium ion battery packs. 
  I received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://www.nit.ac.ir/en/">Babol Noshirvani University of Technology</a>  and <a href="https://www.aut.ac.ir/en/">Tehran Polytechnic (Amirkabir University of Technology)</a> in Iran.
  I consider myself as an engineer and artist and I love working on both ends. I like complex problem solving and coming up with an efficient solution. I am passionate about learning new technologies and implementing them. In my free time, I usually draw, paint, or read (while listening to music). Finally, I love listening to great music and being in nature.
